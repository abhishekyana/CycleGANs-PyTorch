### IF you want to replicate these results may be on different dataset. Read More..
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/abhishekyana/CycleGANs-PyTorch.git
cd CycleGANs-PyTorch
# As this is a huge project, I'd suggest to make a conda environment and then run the training and all.
```
1. Install all the requirements from requirements.txt file:
1. Download the dataset, It can be grabbed from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishekyana/young2old-dataset).
1. Unzip and Move the dataset folder into this project's root directory.


### Thank you
This project is inspired from [Aitor Ruano](https://github.com/aitorzip) and I would like to thank him for providing such a beautiful code which I used to clarify my doubts during the implementation.
